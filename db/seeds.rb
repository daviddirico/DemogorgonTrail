# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)



# already seeded

# Character.create([
#     {user_id: 1, name: "Skeleton Warrior", hero: false, race: "skeleton", classification: "warrior", level: 1, strength: 3, defense: 3, hitpoints: 3},
#     {user_id: 1, name: "Skeleton Ranger", hero: false, race: "skeleton", classification: "ranger", level: 1, strength: 4, defense: 2, hitpoints: 2},
